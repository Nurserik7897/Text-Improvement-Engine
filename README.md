#Text Improvement Engine
The Text Improvement Engine is a Python script that analyzes input text and suggests improvements based on a list of standardized phrases. These standardized phrases represent ideal ways certain concepts should be articulated, and the tool recommends changes to align the input text closer to these standards.

#Features
Data Input: Allows users to input text from a text file.
Standardized Phrases: Pre-loads the tool with a list of standardized phrases (e.g., business jargon, scientific terminology, etc.).
Text Analysis: Utilizes a pre-trained language model to find phrases in the input text that are semantically similar to any of the standard phrases.
Suggestions: Provides a list of suggestions to replace non-standard phrases in the input text with their more "standard" versions, along with similarity scores.
